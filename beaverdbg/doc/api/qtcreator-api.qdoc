    Qt Creator is Qt Software's crossplatform IDE. The core of Qt Creator is
    basically only a \l{ExtensionSystem}{plugin loader}.
    All functionality is implemented in plugins, the basis of Qt Creator is
    implemented in the \l{Core} {Core} Plugin. The plugin manager provides
    simple means for plugin cooperation that allow plugins to provide
    hooks for other plugin's extensions.
