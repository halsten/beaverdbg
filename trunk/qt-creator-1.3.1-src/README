Compiling Qt Creator

You need Qt 4.6 to build Qt Creator.
We recommend that you build Qt Creator not in the source directory, but in a separate directory.
To do that, use the following commands:
mkdir $BUILD_DIRECTORY
cd $BUILD_DIRECTORY
qmake $SOURCE_DIRECTORY/qtcreator.pro
make (or mingw32-make or nmake, depending on your platform)
