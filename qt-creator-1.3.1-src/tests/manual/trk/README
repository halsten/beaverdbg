Run ./run.sh  in one terminal.
Run ./welsh-gdb or ./symbianelf-gdb in a second terminal.
Note that welsh-gdb does not handle 'set remote noack-packet on'

The following items "work":

- "stop" at E32Main
- manual relocation on the gdb side using
  add-symbol-file filebrowseapp.sym 0x786A4000
- disassembly at stopped location
- p <functionname>
- p $pc
- one level of 'bt'

To do:

- figure out why the result of the qOffsets query is not honoured
  _or_ how to have gdb doing the relocation automatically
- setting breakpoints by filename:line
- signaling of stopped/single step end. SIGTRAP? SIGSTOP?
- run it against the red brick


Setting up TRK on Linux with Bluetooth 

Enter the following commands in a terminal (all as root, adjust device
permissions as required to work as user):


sdptool add SP  # announce Serial Port Profile via Service Discovery Protocol
sudo mknod --mode=666 /dev/rfcomm0 c 216 0  # Creates a Bluetooth Serial Device

rfcomm listen /dev/rfcomm0 1 $PWD/trklauncher -v -f {}

#This should print the Trk/CPU versions. The option -f tells the command to
#disable the serial frames message encapsulation for BlueTooth.

#The same with the debug adapter:

rfcomm listen /dev/rfcomm0 1 $PWD/run.pl -af -av -w {}
rfcomm listen /dev/rfcomm0 1 $PWD/runner -af -av -w {}

#Important options: -w wait for adapter, -af omit serial frame.
